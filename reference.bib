  abstract = {This paper outlines about the most advanced technique of Artificial Intelligence for digitally ascertaining a criminal through facial recognition system by converting forensic sketch into a real photo using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Suppose a crime act is reported to a cop as an eyewitness by an individual by remembering certain set of facial features of an illicit and trying to imitate it in the form of hand drawn sketch based on the given information. The forensic sketch is pictured by an expert based on the verbal explanation given by a person after commitment of crime by a perpetrator. The rough sketch is given as an input to train the neural network and after several epochs the network quickly learns and generates a scrupulous realistic facial image of a suspect from the forensic sketch. This is very much helpful in crime investigations to obtain several such real photographs of a suspect from forensic sketches easily with precise details within a short period of time. This is an amazing practice that can produce real facial images of high resolution color photos from a low quality sketches which is incomplete or partial in nature with different pose variations like color, tone etc. It is very much useful in domains like forensics, law enforcement, Facial recognition system and security and authentication systems.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

With the advent of deep generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs), attempts have been made to synthesize face images from attributes and text descriptions. In this paper, we take a different approach, where we formulate the original problem as a stage-wise learning problem. We first synthesize the facial sketch corresponding to the visual attributes and then we reconstruct the face image based on the synthesized sketch. The proposed Attribute2Sketch2Face framework, which is based on a combination of deep Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), consists of three stages: (1) Synthesis of facial sketch from attributes using a CVAE architecture, (2) Enhancement of coarse sketches to produce sharper sketches using a GAN-based framework, and (3) Synthesis of face from sketch using another GAN-based network. Extensive experiments and comparison with recent methods are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attribute-based three stage face synthesis method.},

One of the most important challenges of this task is the inherent differences between the sketch and the real image such as the lack of color and details of the skin tissue in the sketch. With the advent of adversarial generative models, an increasing number of methods have been proposed for sketch-to-image synthesis. However, these models still suffer from limitations such as the large number of paired data required for training, the low resolution of the produced images, or the unrealistic appearance of the generated images.

To do so, we use a pre-trained face photo generating model to synthesize high-quality natural face photos and employ an optimization procedure to keep high-fidelity to the input sketch. We train a network to map the facial features extracted from the input sketch to a vector in the latent space of the face generating model. Also, we study different optimization criteria and compare the results of the proposed model with those of the state-of-the-art models quantitatively and qualitatively.

We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned beta {$>$} 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.},

Existing image-to-image translation methods require a large-scale dataset of paired sketches and images for supervision. They typically utilize synthesized edge maps of face images as training data. However, these synthesized edge maps strictly align with the edges of the corresponding face images, which limit their generalization ability to real hand-drawn sketches with vast stroke diversity. To address this problem, we propose DeepFacePencil, an effective tool that is able to generate photo-realistic face images from hand-drawn sketches, based on a novel dual generator image translation network during training. A novel spatial attention pooling (SAP) is designed to adaptively handle stroke distortions which are spatially varying to support various stroke styles and different levels of details. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing methods on both image quality and model generalization to hand-drawn sketches.},

In this work, we propose a two-stage sketch-to-photo generative adversarial network for face generation. In the first stage, we propose a semantic loss to maintain semantic consistency. In the second stage, we define the similar connected component and propose a color refinement loss to generate fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a multi-scale discriminator and design a patch-level local discriminator. We also propose a texture loss to enhance the local fidelity of synthesized images.

  abstract = {Predicting face attributes in the wild is challenging due to complex face variations. We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are finetuned jointly with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation. (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies. (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with imagelevel attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works. (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pretraining with massive face identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear combination of these concepts.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate image generation guided by hand sketch. When the input sketch is badly drawn, the output of common image-to-image translation follows the input edges due to the hard condition imposed by the translation process. Instead, we propose to use sketch as weak constraint, where the output edges do not necessarily follow the input edges. We address this problem using a novel joint image completion approach, where the sketch provides the image context for completing, or generating the output image. We train a generated adversarial network, i.e, contextual GAN to learn the joint distribution of sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our contextual GAN has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for simple and effective learning of joint distribution in the same image-sketch space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features as previous conditional GANs do. Third, from the joint image's point of view, image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments evaluated on three different datasets show that our contextual GAN can generate more realistic images than state-of-the-art conditional GANs on challenging inputs and generalize well on common categories.},

abstract = {Does a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) consistently encode typical samples generated from its decoder? This paper shows that the perhaps surprising answer to this question is 'No'; a (nominally trained) VAE does not necessarily amortize inference for typical samples that it is capable of generating. We study the implications of this behaviour on the learned representations and also the consequences of fixing it by introducing a notion of self consistency. Our approach hinges on an alternative construction of the variational approximation distribution to the true posterior of an extended VAE model with a Markov chain alternating between the encoder and the decoder. The method can be used to train a VAE model from scratch or given an already trained VAE, it can be run as a post processing step in an entirely self supervised way without access to the original training data. Our experimental analysis reveals that encoders trained with our self-consistency approach lead to representations that are robust (insensitive) to perturbations in the input introduced by adversarial attacks. We provide experimental results on the ColorMnist and CelebA benchmark datasets that quantify the properties of the learned representations and compare the approach with a baseline that is specifically trained for the desired property.},

Also, we introduced an intermediate mapping network called c-Map that combines textual and visual-based features to a disentangled latent space {\textbackslash}mathcal W+ for better feature matching. Furthermore to maximise the computational performance of our model, we implemented a linear-based attention scheme along the pipeline of our model to eliminate the drawbacks of inefficient attention modules that are quadratic in complexity. Finally, the hierarchical setting of our model ensures that textual, style and content features are synthesised based on their unique fine grained details, which result in visually appealing images.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {Face image-sketch synthesis is widely applied in law enforcement and digital entertainment fields. Despite the extensive progression in face image-sketch synthesis, there are few methods focusing on generating a color face image from a sketch. The existing methods pay less attention to learning the illumination or highlight distribution on the face region. However, the illumination is the key factor that makes the generated color face image looks vivid and realistic. Moreover, existing methods tend to employ some image preprocessing technologies and facial region patching approaches to generate high-quality face images, which results in the high complexity and memory consumption in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end generative adversarial fusion model, called GAF, which fuses two U-Net generators and a discriminator by jointly learning the content and adversarial loss functions. In particular, we propose a parametric tanh activation function to learn and control illumination highlight distribution over faces, which is integrated between the two U-Net generators by an illumination distribution layer. Additionally, we fuse the attention mechanism into the second U-Net generator of GAF to keep the identity consistency and refine the generated facial details. The qualitative and quantitative experiments on the public benchmark datasets show that the proposed GAF has better performance than existing image-sketch synthesis methods in synthesized face image quality (FSIM) and face recognition accuracy (NLDA). Meanwhile, the good generalization ability of GAF has also been verified. To further demonstrate the reliability and authenticity of face images generated using GAF, we use the generated face image to attack the well-known face recognition system. The result shows that the face images generated by GAF can maintain identity consistency and well maintain everyone's unique facial characteristics, which can be further used in the benchmark of facial spoofing. Moreover, the experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed parametric tanh activation function and attention mechanism in GAF.},

However, photo/sketch synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact that photo and sketch have different characteristics. In this work, we consider this task as an image-to-image translation problem and explore the recently popular generative models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic photos from sketches and sketches from photos. Recent GAN-based methods have shown promising results on image-to-image translation problems and photo-to-sketch synthesis in particular, however, they are known to have limited abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images. To this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework called Photo-Sketch Synthesis using Multi-Adversarial Networks, (PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution to high resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of the generator are supervised to first generate lower resolution images followed by implicit refinement in the network to generate higher resolution images. Furthermore, since photo-sketch synthesis is a coupled/paired translation problem, we leverage the pair information using CycleGAN framework. Both Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Photo-Sketch Matching experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in comparison to existing state-of-the-art solutions.

The proposed method consists of three components: StyleGAN inversion module, visual-linguistic similarity learning, and instance-level optimization. The inversion module maps real images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. The visual-linguistic similarity learns the text-image matching by mapping the image and text into a common embedding space. The instance-level optimization is for identity preservation in manipulation. Our model can produce diverse and high-quality images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024. Using a control mechanism based on style-mixing, our TediGAN inherently supports image synthesis with multi-modal inputs, such as sketches or semantic labels, with or without instance guidance. To facilitate text-guided multi-modal synthesis, we propose the Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ, a large-scale dataset consisting of real face images and corresponding semantic segmentation map, sketch, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on the introduced dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/weihaox/TediGAN.},

To tackle this challenge, in this work, we propose to use the facial composition information to help the synthesis of face sketch/photo. Specially, we propose a novel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for face photo-sketch synthesis. In CA-GAN, we utilize paired inputs including a face photo/sketch and the corresponding pixel-wise face labels for generating a sketch/photo. In addition, to focus training on hard-generated components and delicate facial structures, we propose a compositional reconstruction loss. Finally, we use stacked CA-GANs (SCA-GAN) to further rectify defects and add compelling details. Experimental results show that our method is capable of generating both visually comfortable and identity-preserving face sketches/photos over a wide range of challenging data. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art quality, reducing best previous Frechet Inception distance (FID) by a large margin. Besides, we demonstrate that the proposed method is of considerable generalization ability. We have made our code and results publicly available: https://fei-hdu.github.io/ca-gan/.},

  abstract = {Face photo-sketch synthesis aims at generating a facial sketch/photo conditioned on a given photo/sketch. It covers wide applications including digital entertainment and law enforcement. Precisely depicting face photos/sketches remains challenging due to the restrictions on structural realism and textural consistency. While existing methods achieve compelling results, they mostly yield blurred effects and great deformation over various facial components, leading to the unrealistic feeling of synthesized images. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose using facial composition information to help the synthesis of face sketch/photo. Especially, we propose a novel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for face photo-sketch synthesis. In CA-GAN, we utilize paired inputs, including a face photo/sketch and the corresponding pixelwise face labels for generating a sketch/photo. Next, to focus training on hard-generated components and delicate facial structures, we propose a compositional reconstruction loss. In addition, we employ a perceptual loss function to encourage the synthesized image and real image to be perceptually similar. Finally, we use stacked CA-GANs (SCA-GANs) to further rectify defects and add compelling details. The experimental results show that our method is capable of generating both visually comfortable and identity-preserving face sketches/photos over a wide range of challenging data. In addition, our method significantly decreases the best previous Fr{\'e}chet inception distance (FID) from 36.2 to 26.2 for sketch synthesis, and from 60.9 to 30.5 for photo synthesis. Besides, we demonstrate that the proposed method is of considerable generalization ability.},

GANs involve a pair of neural networks engaged in a competition in iteratively creating fake data, indistinguishable from the real data. One notable application of GANs is developing fake human faces, also known as "deep fakes," due to the deep learning algorithms at the core of the GAN framework. Measuring the quality of the generated images is inherently subjective but attempts to objectify quality using standardized metrics have been made. One example of objective metrics is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the difference between distributions of feature vectors for two separate datasets of images. There are situations that images with low perceptual qualities are not assigned appropriate FID scores. We propose to improve the robustness of the evaluation process by integrating lower-level features to cover a wider array of visual defects. Our proposed method integrates three levels of feature abstractions to evaluate the quality of generated images. Experimental evaluations show better performance of the proposed method for distorted images.},

abstract="The outstanding performance capabilities of large language model have driven the evolution of current AI system interaction patterns. This has led to considerable discussion within the Human-AI Interaction (HAII) community. Numerous studies explore this interaction from technical, design, and empirical perspectives. However, the majority of current literature reviews concentrate on interactions across the wider spectrum of AI, with limited attention given to the specific realm of interaction with LLM. We searched for articles on human interaction with LLM, selecting 110 relevant publications meeting consensus definition of Human-AI interaction. Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive Mapping Procedure, structured in five distinct stages, to systematically analyze and categorize the collected publications. Applying this methodical approach, we meticulously mapped the chosen studies, culminating in a detailed and insightful representation of the research landscape. Overall, our review presents an novel approach, introducing a distinctive mapping method, specifically tailored to evaluate human-LLM interaction patterns. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the current research in related fields, employing clustering techniques for categorization, which enabled us to clearly delineate the status and challenges prevalent in each identified area.",

abstract = {Developing novel research questions (RQs) often requires extensive literature reviews, especially in interdisciplinary fields. To support RQ development through human-AI co-creation, we leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an LLM-based agent system named CoQuest. We conducted an experiment with 20 HCI researchers to examine the impact of two interaction designs: breadth-first and depth-first RQ generation. The findings revealed that participants perceived the breadth-first approach as more creative and trustworthy upon task completion. Conversely, during the task, participants considered the depth-first generated RQs as more creative. Additionally, we discovered that AI processing delays allowed users to reflect on multiple RQs simultaneously, leading to a higher quantity of generated RQs and an enhanced sense of control. Our work makes both theoretical and practical contributions by proposing and evaluating a mental model for human-AI co-creation of RQs. We also address potential ethical issues, such as biases and over-reliance on AI, advocating for using the system to improve human research creativity rather than automating scientific inquiry.

    abstract = { Multi-label zero-shot learning (ML-ZSL) strives to recognize all objects in an image, regardless of whether they are present in the training data. Recent methods incorporate an attention mechanism to locate labels in the image and generate class-specific semantic information. However, the attention mechanism built on visual features treats label embeddings equally in the prediction score, leading to severe semantic ambiguity. This study focuses on efficiently utilizing semantic information in the attention mechanism. We propose a contrastive label-based attention method (CLA) to associate each label with the most relevant image regions. Specifically, our label-based attention, guided by the latent label embedding, captures discriminative image details. To distinguish region-wise correlations, we implement a region-level contrastive loss. In addition, we utilize a global feature alignment module to identify labels with general information. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, NUS-WIDE and Open Images, demonstrate that our CLA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Especially under the ZSL setting, our method achieves 2.0\% improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) for NUS-WIDE and 4.0\% for Open Images compared with recent methods. }

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

We provide an in-depth review of recent advances in representation learning with a focus on autoencoder-based models. To organize these results we make use of meta-priors believed useful for downstream tasks, such as disentanglement and hierarchical organization of features. In particular, we uncover three main mechanisms to enforce such properties, namely (i) regularizing the (approximate or aggregate) posterior distribution, (ii) factorizing the encoding and decoding distribution, or (iii) introducing a structured prior distribution. While there are some promising results, implicit or explicit supervision remains a key enabler and all current methods use strong inductive biases and modeling assumptions. Finally, we provide an analysis of autoencoder-based representation learning through the lens of rate-distortion theory and identify a clear tradeoff between the amount of prior knowledge available about the downstream tasks, and how useful the representation is for this task.},

Our goal is to model the diversity intrinsic to the problem of colorization and produce multiple colorizations that display long-scale spatial co-ordination. We learn a low dimensional embedding of color fields using a variational autoencoder (VAE). We construct loss terms for the VAE decoder that avoid blurry outputs and take into account the uneven distribution of pixel colors. Finally, we build a conditional model for the multi-modal distribution between grey-level image and the color field embeddings. Samples from this conditional model result in diverse colorization. We demonstrate that our method obtains better diverse colorizations than a standard conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) model, as well as a recently proposed conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN).},

We study unsupervised sketch-to-photo synthesis for the first time, learning from unpaired sketch-photo data where the target photo for a sketch is unknown during training. Existing works only deal with style change or spatial deformation alone, synthesizing photos from edge-aligned line drawings or transforming shapes within the same modality, e.g., color images. Our key insight is to decompose unsupervised sketch-to-photo synthesis into a two-stage translation task: First shape translation from sketches to grayscale photos and then content enrichment from grayscale to color photos. We also incorporate a self-supervised denoising objective and an attention module to handle abstraction and style variations that are inherent and specific to sketches. Our synthesis is sketch-faithful and photo-realistic to enable sketch-based image retrieval in practice. An exciting corollary product is a universal and promising sketch generator that captures human visual perception beyond the edge map of a photo.},

Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.},

	abstract = {A video-based monitoring system must be capable of continuous operation under various weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, background subtraction is a very important part of surveillance applications for successful segmentation of objects from video sequences, and the accuracy, computational complexity, and memory requirements of the initial background extraction are crucial in any background subtraction method. This paper proposes an algorithm to extract initial color backgrounds from surveillance videos using a probability-based background extraction algorithm. With the proposed algorithm, the initial background can be extracted accurately and quickly, while using relatively little memory. The intrusive objects can then be segmented quickly and correctly by a robust object segmentation algorithm. The segmentation algorithm analyzes the threshold values of the background subtraction from the prior frame to obtain good quality while minimizing execution time and maximizing detection accuracy. The color background images can be extracted efficiently and quickly from color image sequences and updated in real time to overcome any variation in illumination conditions. Experimental results for various environmental sequences and a quantitative evaluation are provided to demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and memory economy of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, specifically text-to-image generators, across various domains has had a profound impact on numerous fields. Despite this, the potential applications of AI image generators in architectural education, particularly in teaching the history of architecture, remain underexplored. This research aims to uncover the possibilities of utilizing AI image generators, with a specific focus on the capabilities of Leonardo AI, to enhance communication and engagement. This study employed an experimental methodology to investigate how the integration of AI image generators in education on the subject of “History of Architecture” promises to elevate the learning experience, offering new perspectives, visualizations, and interactive tools. Two workshops were conducted with university students to explore AI image generators’ potential applications in architectural history education. The first workshop utilized an iterative approach, while the second aimed to assess students’ analytical skills. The ultimate objective was to determine the capabilities of this tool and stimulate discussions regarding its potential future implementations. Following the workshops, online questionnaires were administered to students, and interviews were conducted with educators. The findings of this research underscore the need for validating AI-generated images, establishing guidelines to prevent misuse, and designing tailored AI tools for History of Architecture courses, thereby paving the way for further advancements in architectural history education.},

            Sketch2Prototype is an AI-based framework that transforms a hand-drawn sketch into a diverse set of 2D images and 3D prototypes through sketch-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-3D stages. This framework, shown across various sketches, rapidly generates text, image, and 3D modalities for enhanced early-stage design exploration. We show that using text as an intermediate modality outperforms direct sketch-to-3D baselines for generating diverse and manufacturable 3D models. We find limitations in current image-to-3D techniques, while noting the value of the text modality for user-feedback.},

Here, we propose Sketch-And-Paint GAN (SAPGAN), the first model which generates Chinese landscape paintings from end to end, without conditional input. SAPGAN is composed of two GANs: SketchGAN for generation of edge maps, and PaintGAN for subsequent edge-to-painting translation. Our model is trained on a new dataset of traditional Chinese landscape paintings never before used for generative research. A 242-person Visual Turing Test study reveals that SAPGAN paintings are mistaken as human artwork with 55\% frequency, significantly outperforming paintings from baseline GANs. Our work lays a groundwork for truly machine-original art generation.},

	abstract = {Automatic face photo-sketch recognition has important applications for law enforcement. Recent research has focused on transforming photos and sketches into the same modality for matching or developing advanced classification algorithms to reduce the modality gap between features extracted from photos and sketches. In this paper, we propose a new inter-modality face recognition approach by reducing the modality gap at the feature extraction stage. A new face descriptor based on coupled information-theoretic encoding is used to capture discriminative local face structures and to effectively match photos and sketches. Guided by maximizing the mutual information between photos and sketches in the quantized feature spaces, the coupled encoding is achieved by the proposed coupled information-theoretic projection tree, which is extended to the randomized forest to further boost the performance. We create the largest face sketch database including sketches of 1, 194 people from the FERET database. Experiments on this large scale dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},
